Batteries with intercalation-conversion-type electrodes tend to achieve high-capacity storage, but the complicated reaction process often suffers from confusing electrochemical mechanisms. Here, we reinterpreted the essential issue about the potential of the conversion reaction and whether there is an intercalation reaction in a lithium/sodium-ion battery (LIB/SIB) with the FeP anode based on the evolution of the magnetic phase. Especially, the ever-present intercalation process in a large voltage range followed by the conversion reaction with extremely low potential was confirmed in FeP LIB, while it is mainly the conversion reaction for the sodium storage mechanism in FeP SIB. The insufficient conversion reaction profoundly limits the actual capacity to the expectedly respectable value. Accordingly, a graphene oxide modification strategy was proposed to increase the reversible capacity of FeP LIB/SIB by 99% and 132%, respectively. The results facilitate the development of anode materials with a high capacity and low operating potential.
