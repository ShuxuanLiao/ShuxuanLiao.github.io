Recovered from spent lithium manganate batteries (LiMn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>), λ-MnO<sub>2</sub> exhibits a high energy density as a cathode material for sodium-ion batteries. During the charge–discharge cycles, the discharge specific capacity progressively increases, reaching a maximum of 219.3 mA h g<sup>−1</sup>.
