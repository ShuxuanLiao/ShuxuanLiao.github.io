# Patent

* Q. Li, S. Liao, et al. *A Recycling Method for Lithium-Ion Batteries and Spin Capacitance Mechanism*. Patent Application No. 2024116995691. Status: Application accepted and under review by CNIPA.

# Research Experience

* **Space Charge Behavior of SEI Probed by Fe3C Magnetic Response** (Apr. 2023 – Present)
  Supervisors: Prof. Qiang Li

  * Employed Fe3C as a magnetic probe material to investigate space-charge storage behavior in the SEI layer through operando magnetometry.
  * Quantified an additional space-charge capacity of \~236 mAh·g⁻¹ within the voltage range of 0.01–1.4 V.
  * Demonstrated that the SEI functions as an ion-conductive interface that hosts spin-polarized electrons, enabling interface space-charge storage.

* **Magneto-electrochemical Study and Upcycling of LiFePO4 Cathodes** (Nov. 2023 – Apr. 2024)
  Supervisors: Prof. Qiang Li & Prof. Yuxiang Hu

  * Investigated charge storage mechanism of LiFePO4 in the low-voltage window based on prior understanding of space-charge behavior.
  * Proposed a strategy for direct upcycling of spent LiFePO4 into high-performance supercapacitor materials via gradient phase-reconstruction approach.

* **Ligand Hole Evolution in Layered Sodium-ion Cathodes** (May 2024 – Present)
  Supervisors: Prof. Qiang Li & Prof. Guoxing Miao

  * Investigated ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) and ligand-hole generation in Na₂/₃Cu₁/₃Mn₂/₃O₂.
  * Identified antiferromagnetic-to-ferromagnetic transition during electrochemical cycling.
  * Proposed generalized magneto-electrochemical model for strongly hybridized materials.
