I received my B.Eng. in Optoelectronic Information Science and Engineering from Nanjing Tech University and my M.Eng. in Materials Engineering from Qingdao University, where I conducted research under the supervision of Prof. Qiang Li.  
Driven by a strong interest in interdisciplinary research, I have built experience across several domains. As an undergraduate, I worked on flexible optoelectronic devices and cloud-based control systems for smart home applications. During my masterâ€™s studies, my research centered on magneto-electrochemistry, where I employed magnetic techniques to investigate energy storage mechanisms in lithium/sodium-ion batteries.  
With a multidisciplinary background bridging optoelectronics, microelectronics, and magneto-electrochemistry, I am particularly interested in exploring microelectronics-related directions such as semiconductor devices, flexible electronics, and energy storage materials. My long-term goal is to develop novel functional devices enabled by multi-physics coupling mechanisms.
